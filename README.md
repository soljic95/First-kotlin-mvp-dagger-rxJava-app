Test app to see how Kotlin works.
The goal is to create an app that allows you to create an account and save that account in the Room database. Once the user has created his account he will be able to search CryptoCoins and display the search results in a recyclerView. User will have an option to save favourite coins and see their value as soon as he opens the app. User will have the option to remove coins from favourites and also the option to log out and or/delete his account.
